# Cosmos SDK Bridge Module (Future Implementation)

This directory contains the foundation for a future Cosmos SDK bridge module that will extend the Nexus Bridge to support Cosmos ecosystem chains.

## Current Status

**Phase 1 Complete**: Basic bridge infrastructure implemented focusing on Ethereum and Polygon chains.

**Phase 2 Planned**: Cosmos SDK integration for IBC-enabled cross-chain transfers.

## Architecture Overview

The Cosmos bridge module will integrate with the existing bridge infrastructure to provide:

### Core Components

1. **Cosmos SDK Module** (`module.go`)

   - Standard Cosmos SDK module implementation
   - Message routing and handling
   - Genesis state management
   - Query and transaction services

2. **Message Types** (`types/msgs.go`)

   - `MsgLockTokens`: Lock tokens for cross-chain transfer
   - `MsgUnlockTokens`: Unlock tokens with multi-signature validation

3. **Keeper** (`keeper/keeper.go`)

   - State management for transfers and token registry
   - Validator set management for relayer consensus
   - IBC packet handling and processing

4. **IBC Integration** (`keeper/ibc_handler.go`)
   - IBC packet lifecycle management
   - Cross-chain communication with other Cosmos chains
   - Timeout and acknowledgment handling

### Key Features (Planned)

- **IBC Transfers**: Native support for Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol
- **Token Registry**: Manage supported denominations and metadata
- **Validator Set Management**: Relayer consensus for cross-chain operations
- **Multi-signature Validation**: Secure unlock operations with threshold signatures
- **Cross-chain State Sync**: Consistent state management across chains

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2.1: Core Module Development

- [ ] Complete Cosmos SDK module implementation
- [ ] Implement message handlers with proper validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integrate with existing bridge infrastructure

### Phase 2.2: IBC Integration

- [ ] Implement IBC packet handling
- [ ] Add cross-chain communication protocols
- [ ] Test with Cosmos testnet environments
- [ ] Optimize for production deployment

### Phase 2.3: Production Readiness

- [ ] Security audit and testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides
- [ ] Integration with monitoring systems

## Dependencies

When implementing Phase 2, the following dependencies will be required:

```go
require (
    github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk v0.47.x
    github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7 v7.x.x
    github.com/tendermint/tendermint v0.37.x
)
```

## Integration Points

The Cosmos module will integrate with existing bridge components:

- **Chain Adapter Interface**: Implement `ChainAdapter` for Cosmos chains
- **State Manager**: Extend for Cosmos-specific state management
- **Event Processing**: Handle Cosmos events and IBC packets
- **API Services**: Expose Cosmos bridge operations via REST API

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of all module components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with local Cosmos chains
- **IBC Tests**: Cross-chain communication testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for high-volume scenarios

## Current Files

The following files contain the foundation for the Cosmos implementation:

- `bridge.go`: Simplified bridge logic for testing and development
- `bridge_test.go`: Unit tests for core bridge functionality
- `types/`: Type definitions and validation logic
- `keeper/`: State management and business logic
- `module.go`: Cosmos SDK module implementation

## Getting Started (Future)

When Phase 2 development begins:

1. Update `go.mod` with Cosmos SDK dependencies
2. Complete the keeper implementation
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Integrate with existing bridge infrastructure
5. Deploy to testnet for validation

## Contributing

This is a planned future feature. The current implementation provides the foundation, but full Cosmos SDK integration will be developed in Phase 2 of the project.

For questions or suggestions about the Cosmos integration, please refer to the main project documentation or create an issue in the project repository.

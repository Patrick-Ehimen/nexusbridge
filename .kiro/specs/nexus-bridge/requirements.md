# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NexusBridge is a cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables secure asset transfers between multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum (mainnet), Polygon (Layer 2), and Cosmos-based chains. The system consists of smart contracts for asset locking/minting, a Go-based relayer service for cross-chain communication, and monitoring infrastructure to ensure reliable and secure transfers. The bridge supports ERC-20 tokens initially with the capability to extend to other asset types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want to transfer ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Polygon, so that I can trade on Polygon's lower-cost network while maintaining asset security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a token transfer from Ethereum to Polygon THEN the system SHALL lock the specified amount of tokens in the Ethereum bridge contract
2. WHEN tokens are locked on Ethereum THEN the system SHALL emit a Lock event containing user address, token amount, destination chain, and destination address
3. WHEN the relayer detects a Lock event THEN the system SHALL validate the event authenticity and trigger minting on Polygon
4. WHEN minting is triggered on Polygon THEN the system SHALL mint equivalent tokens to the user's specified address
5. IF the lock transaction fails THEN the system SHALL revert the transaction and return an error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want to transfer assets from Polygon back to Ethereum, so that I can access Ethereum's broader DeFi ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a token transfer from Polygon to Ethereum THEN the system SHALL burn the specified amount of tokens on Polygon
2. WHEN tokens are burned on Polygon THEN the system SHALL emit a Burn event with transfer details
3. WHEN the relayer detects a Burn event THEN the system SHALL validate the event and trigger token release on Ethereum
4. WHEN token release is triggered THEN the system SHALL unlock the equivalent tokens from the Ethereum bridge contract
5. IF insufficient tokens are locked in the bridge contract THEN the system SHALL reject the transfer and emit an error event

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want to integrate Cosmos-based chains into the bridge, so that users can transfer assets across different blockchain ecosystems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Cosmos-based chain is integrated THEN the system SHALL support asset transfers between Ethereum/Polygon and the Cosmos chain
2. WHEN transferring to a Cosmos chain THEN the system SHALL use the Cosmos SDK for chain interactions
3. WHEN transferring from a Cosmos chain THEN the system SHALL handle IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol requirements
4. WHEN a Cosmos chain transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the same security guarantees as Ethereum/Polygon transfers
5. IF a Cosmos chain is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating for Ethereum/Polygon transfers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the relayer to operate securely with multi-signature validation, so that no single point of failure can compromise the bridge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing cross-chain transfers THEN the system SHALL require cryptographic signatures from multiple authorized relayers
2. WHEN a relayer signs a transaction THEN the system SHALL verify the signature using ECDSA cryptographic validation
3. WHEN insufficient valid signatures are collected THEN the system SHALL reject the cross-chain transfer
4. WHEN a relayer attempts unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and block the relayer
5. IF a relayer's private key is compromised THEN the system SHALL allow key rotation without stopping bridge operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a bridge operator, I want real-time monitoring of cross-chain transactions, so that I can ensure system health and quickly respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-chain transfers occur THEN the system SHALL log all transaction details including timestamps, amounts, and addresses
2. WHEN the monitoring system is queried THEN it SHALL provide real-time status of pending, completed, and failed transfers
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the monitoring system SHALL send alerts to operators
4. WHEN chain reorganizations happen THEN the system SHALL detect them and handle affected transactions appropriately
5. IF the relayer service goes down THEN the monitoring system SHALL immediately alert operators and attempt automatic restart

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a REST API to interact with the bridge programmatically, so that I can integrate bridge functionality into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a transfer request THEN it SHALL validate the request parameters and initiate the appropriate blockchain transaction
2. WHEN queried for transfer status THEN the API SHALL return current status including confirmation counts and estimated completion time
3. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the API SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive messages
4. WHEN the API is under high load THEN it SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for status queries
5. IF the API service is unavailable THEN client applications SHALL receive proper error responses to handle gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want comprehensive transaction validation and error handling, so that the bridge maintains security even under adverse conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL wait for sufficient block confirmations before considering transactions final
2. WHEN chain reorganizations occur THEN the system SHALL detect affected transactions and handle them appropriately
3. WHEN duplicate events are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent double-spending by tracking processed transactions
4. WHEN network failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. IF smart contract calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt recovery procedures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a bridge user, I want transparent fee handling, so that I understand the costs associated with cross-chain transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a transfer THEN the system SHALL calculate and display estimated fees for both source and destination chains
2. WHEN fees are collected THEN the system SHALL distribute them appropriately to relayers and protocol treasury
3. WHEN gas prices fluctuate THEN the system SHALL adjust fee estimates dynamically
4. WHEN a transaction fails due to insufficient fees THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on required fee amounts
5. IF fee calculation fails THEN the system SHALL use conservative estimates to ensure transaction success
